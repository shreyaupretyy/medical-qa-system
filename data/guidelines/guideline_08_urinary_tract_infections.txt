**Urinary Tract Infections**
**Category:** Infectious Disease

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology
Acute cystitis is an acute inflammation of the bladder, primarily affecting women due to their shorter urethra compared to men. Women are affected 10 times more than men.

* Prevalence: 40-50% of all women will develop cystitis in their lifetime.
* Risk factors:
	+ Urethral catheterization
	+ Diabetes

### 2. Clinical Presentation
Signs and symptoms:

* Low-grade fever
* Frequency
* Nocturia
* Urgency
* Dysuria
* Haematuria
* Cloudy and foul-smelling urine
* Low back and suprapubic pain

History findings:

* Previous episodes of UTI
* Recent instrumentation (catheterization, surgery)
* Diabetes mellitus

Physical examination findings:

* Suprapubic tenderness
* Haematuria

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup
Diagnostic criteria:
* Presence of symptoms (fever, frequency, dysuria, etc.)
* Urinalysis showing >10 WBCs/HPF or positive nitrite test

Laboratory tests:

* Urinalysis: to confirm the presence of infection
* Urine culture: to identify the causative organism and antibiotic sensitivity

Imaging studies:
* Not typically required for uncomplicated UTI, but may be necessary in complicated cases (e.g., pyelonephritis)

Other investigations:
* None mentioned in source material

### 4. Treatment Algorithm
**First-line treatment**

* For uncomplicated cystitis: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days or nitrofurantoin macrocrystals 100 mg PO BID for 5-7 days

**Second-line options**

* Ciprofloxacin 250-500 mg PO BID for 3-7 days
* Levofloxacin 250-500 mg PO QD for 3-7 days

**Treatment modifications based on severity**
* Complicated UTI: adjust treatment according to local guidelines and consider consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

### 5. Management and Follow-up
Monitoring parameters:

* Symptoms resolution
* Urine culture results
* Renal function (creatinine, electrolytes)

Follow-up schedule:
* 1-2 weeks after completion of treatment for uncomplicated UTI

Patient education:

* Importance of completing full treatment course
* Prevention measures (e.g., good hygiene, urinate when needed)
* Recognition of warning signs (e.g., fever, flank pain)

Lifestyle modifications:

* Encourage patients to drink plenty of fluids
* Avoidance of certain medications that may exacerbate UTI symptoms

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions
**Drug contraindications**

* TMP-SMX: pregnancy (category C), renal impairment (creatinine >2 mg/dL)
* Nitrofurantoin: pregnancy (category B3), renal impairment (creatinine >2 mg/dL)

**Special populations**

* Elderly: consider dose adjustment for renal impairment
* Pregnancy: avoid TMP-SMX and nitrofurantoin; use alternative antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate)
* Renal impairment: adjust treatment according to local guidelines

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls
Important clinical tips:

* Consider using a urine culture to guide antibiotic selection, especially in complicated cases.
* Be aware of potential drug interactions and contraindications.

Common pitfalls to avoid:

* Inadequate treatment duration or dosage
* Failure to consider underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, renal impairment)

Red flags:
* Fever >38°C
* Flank pain
* Nausea/vomiting
* Abdominal tenderness

**Note:** Specific protocols should be verified with local guidelines. This guideline is intended as a general framework for managing urinary tract infections and may not reflect the most up-to-date recommendations in all regions.
