**Rheumatoid Arthritis Treatment Guideline**

**Category:** Rheumatology

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterized by synovial hypertrophy and chronic joint inflammation.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** RA affects approximately 0.5-1% of the population worldwide, with a higher prevalence in middle-aged women.
* **Risk Factors:**
	+ Genetic susceptibility
	+ Environmental triggers (e.g., cigarette smoking, infection, trauma)
	+ Presence of autoantibodies (e.g., rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide)

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:**
	+ Joint stiffness
	+ Painful joints
	+ Swelling of affected joints
	+ Deformity of affected joints
	+ Limitation of motion
	+ Skin nodules
	+ Difficulty in breathing
	+ Easy fatiguability
* **History Findings:**
	+ Duration and severity of symptoms
	+ Presence of morning stiffness
	+ Previous joint injuries or infections
* **Physical Examination Findings:**
	+ Persistent symmetric polyarthritis (synovitis) of hands and feet
	+ Joint tenderness
	+ Joint swelling
	+ Joint deformity

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:** RA diagnosis requires the presence of at least four out of seven criteria, including:
	+ Morning stiffness lasting more than one hour
	+ Symmetric joint involvement
	+ Rheumatoid factor positivity
	+ Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positivity
	+ Presence of rheumatoid nodules
	+ Extra-articular manifestations (e.g., lung disease, uveitis)
* **Laboratory Tests:**
	+ Complete blood count (CBC)
	+ Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
	+ C-reactive protein (CRP)
	+ Rheumatoid factor (RF)
	+ Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody
* **Imaging Studies:** X-rays of affected joints to assess joint damage and deformity

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

* **First-Line Treatment:**
	+ Diclofenac spray, topical:
		- Apply 12 hourly as necessary
		- Evidence Rating: [C]
* **Second-Line Options:**
	+ Methylprednisolone acetate, intra-articular:
		- Consult specialist
	+ Triamcinolone, intra-articular:
		- Consult specialist
	+ Betamethasone, intra-articular:
		- Consult specialist

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:**
	+ Disease activity (e.g., ESR, CRP)
	+ Joint damage progression (e.g., X-rays)
	+ Patient-reported outcomes (e.g., pain, function)
* **Follow-up Schedule:** Regular follow-ups with a rheumatologist or primary care physician to adjust treatment and monitor disease activity.
* **Patient Education:**
	+ Importance of medication adherence
	+ Lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise, smoking cessation)
	+ Monitoring for potential side effects

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:** Consult local guidelines for specific contraindications.
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Elderly: Consider age-related comorbidities and potential drug interactions
	+ Pregnancy: Avoid certain medications (e.g., methotrexate)
	+ Renal impairment: Adjust doses or choose alternative medications
* **Drug Interactions:** Consult local guidelines for specific interactions.
* **Warning Signs Requiring Escalation:**
	+ Increasing disease activity
	+ Joint damage progression
	+ Presence of extra-articular manifestations

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Important Clinical Tips:**
	+ Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes
	+ Regular follow-ups are crucial for adjusting treatment and monitoring disease activity
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
	+ Delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment
	+ Failure to monitor for potential side effects
* **Red Flags:**
	+ Sudden increase in disease activity
	+ Presence of extra-articular manifestations
