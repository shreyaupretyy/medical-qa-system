**Asthma Management**

**Category:** Respiratory

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** Approximately 8.3% of adults and 10.2% of children worldwide suffer from asthma (Source: Global Initiative for Asthma, 2017).
* **Risk Factors:**
	+ Family history
	+ Allergies (e.g., dust mites, pollen)
	+ Respiratory infections
	+ Exposure to tobacco smoke

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:** Wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, coughing, shortness of breath, particularly on exertion.
* **History Findings:**
	+ Recurrent episodes of wheezing and coughing
	+ History of allergies or respiratory infections
	+ Exposure to triggers (e.g., dust mites, pollen)
* **Physical Examination Findings:** Wheezing, use of accessory muscles for breathing, barrel chest.

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:**
	+ Clinical presentation consistent with asthma
	+ Response to bronchodilator therapy
* **Laboratory Tests:**
	+ Full Blood Count (FBC) to rule out anemia or eosinophilia
	+ Spirometry to measure lung function and reversibility
* **Imaging Studies:** Chest X-ray to exclude other diagnoses or complications.
* **Other Investigations:**
	+ Skin prick test or specific IgE for common allergens
	+ Stool examination to exclude helminthiasis

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

**Acute Exacerbation of Asthma**

1. Initial Management in the Community:
	* Salbutamol inhaler (100-200 mcg/puff) using a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer
	* Give 1-2 puffs via a spacer and mask if needed (e.g., Volumatic)
2. First-line Treatment:
	* Salbutamol, inhaled (100 microgram/2 puffs) 4-6 hourly as required
3. Second-line Options:
	* Ipratropium bromide inhaler (20 mcg/puff) using a pMDI with a spacer
	* Corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone propionate, 250 mcg/2 puffs twice daily)

**Chronic Asthma**

1. First-line Treatment:
	* Inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone propionate, 250 mcg/2 puffs twice daily)
	* Long-acting beta-agonists (e.g., salmeterol xinafoate, 50 mcg/2 puffs twice daily)

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:**
	+ Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)
	+ Spirometry
	+ Symptom control
* **Follow-up Schedule:** Regular follow-ups every 4-6 weeks to adjust treatment as needed.
* **Patient Education:** Teach patients about asthma self-management, device use and technique, and lifestyle modifications (e.g., avoiding triggers).
* **Lifestyle Modifications:**
	+ Avoid known triggers/allergens
	+ Quit smoking

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:**
	+ Salbutamol contraindicated in patients with severe asthma or those requiring high doses of corticosteroids.
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Elderly: Use caution when prescribing beta-agonists due to increased risk of adverse effects.
	+ Pregnancy: Avoid using long-acting beta-agonists and corticosteroids unless absolutely necessary.
	+ Renal impairment: Use caution when prescribing medications that require dose adjustments.

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Important Clinical Tips:**
	+ Always use a spacer with inhaled medication to improve delivery and efficacy.
	+ Monitor PEFR regularly to assess treatment effectiveness.
	+ Educate patients about asthma self-management and lifestyle modifications.
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
	+ Underdiagnosing or misdiagnosing asthma
	+ Inadequate treatment of acute exacerbations
	+ Failure to monitor and adjust treatment as needed

**Red Flags:** Severe symptoms, rapid decline in PEFR, or failure to respond to initial treatment.
