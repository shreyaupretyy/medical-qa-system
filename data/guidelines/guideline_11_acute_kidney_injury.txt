**Acute Kidney Injury**

**Category:** Nephrology

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a sudden decrease in renal function occurring over hours to days, resulting in the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and disruption of blood volume, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** AKI affects approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients, with a higher incidence in critically ill patients (1).
* **Risk Factors:**
	+ Pre-existing chronic kidney disease
	+ Volume contraction
	+ Hypotension
	+ Nephrotoxic agents

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:** Oliguria (decreased urine output), anuria, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, flank pain, metallic taste in mouth, hiccups, change in mood.
* **History Findings:**
	+ Recent surgery or trauma
	+ Medications known to cause AKI (e.g., NSAIDs)
	+ Underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension)
* **Physical Examination Findings:** Oliguria, edema, decreased blood pressure

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:**
	+ KDIGO criteria:
		- Stage 1: 1.5-1.9 times baseline serum creatinine or increase of >26.4 micromol/L
		- Stage 2: 2.0-2.9 times baseline serum creatinine or increase of >353.6 micromol/L
		- Stage 3: 3.0 times baseline serum creatinine or anuria for >12 hours
* **Laboratory Tests:** Serum creatinine, urine output, electrolyte panel, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
* **Imaging Studies:** Not typically required for diagnosis, but may be used to evaluate underlying causes of AKI
* **Other Investigations:**
	+ Urinalysis to evaluate for proteinuria or hematuria
	+ Imaging studies to evaluate for obstructive uropathy

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

* **First-Line Treatment:**
	+ Fluid management:
		- Maintain strict fluid input and output chart
		- Avoid volume contraction
	+ Medications:
		- Lisinopril (5-20 mg daily) for control of proteinuria
		- Prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily or 60 mg/m2 in children) for minimal change nephrotic syndrome
* **Second-Line Options:**
	+ Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for severe AKI or refractory to medical management
	+ Consultation with a nephrologist for further management

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum creatinine, urine output, electrolyte panel, BUN
* **Follow-up Schedule:**
	+ Daily monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output
	+ Weekly follow-up with a nephrologist or primary care physician
* **Patient Education:**
	+ Importance of fluid management and medication adherence
	+ Lifestyle modifications (e.g., smoking cessation, weight reduction)
* **Lifestyle Modifications:**
	+ Smoking cessation
	+ Weight reduction if obese
	+ Avoidance of NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic agents

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:** Lisinopril in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Elderly: cautious use of medications, close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output
	+ Pregnancy: careful consideration of medication use, consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist
	+ Renal impairment: cautious use of medications, close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output
* **Drug Interactions:** ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) should not be used together

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Important Clinical Tips:** Close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output, careful fluid management, and consideration of medication use in special populations.
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
	+ Failure to recognize AKI early
	+ Inadequate fluid management
	+ Inappropriate use of medications
* **Red Flags:** Sudden decrease in renal function, anuria, or severe electrolyte imbalances requiring immediate escalation of care.
