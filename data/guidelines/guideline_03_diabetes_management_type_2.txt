**Diabetes Management (Type 2)**

**Category:** Endocrine

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to hyperglycemia.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** According to the source material, there is no specific information on prevalence or incidence rates for Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. However, it is estimated that approximately 9% of pregnancies are affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which often develops into Type 2 diabetes postpartum.
* **Risk Factors:** Risk factors for developing Type 2 diabetes include:
	+ Family history
	+ Obesity
	+ Physical inactivity
	+ Age > 45 years
	+ Ethnicity (e.g., African American, Hispanic/Latino)
	+ Previous history of GDM or delivering a macrosomic baby

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:** Type 2 diabetes is often asymptomatic in its early stages. However, symptoms may include:
	+ Polyuria
	+ Polydipsia
	+ Fatigue
	+ Blurred vision
	+ Slow healing of cuts and wounds
* **History Findings:**
	+ Previous history of GDM or delivering a macrosomic baby
	+ Family history of diabetes
	+ Obesity or physical inactivity
* **Physical Examination Findings:** None specific to Type 2 diabetes

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:** Diagnosis is based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%.
* **Laboratory Tests:**
	+ Fasting plasma glucose
	+ 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose during OGTT
	+ Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
	+ Lipid profile
	+ Renal function tests (e.g., serum creatinine, eGFR)
* **Imaging Studies:** None specific to Type 2 diabetes

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

**First-line treatment:**

* **Dietary modification:** Encourage a balanced diet with emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein sources, and healthy fats.
* **Exercise:** Recommend regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

**Medications:**

* **Metformin (500 mg 8-12 hourly):** First-line pharmacological treatment for Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy. Maximum dose: 2g/day.
* **Glibenclamide (2.5-5 mg 12-24 hourly):** May be used as an alternative to metformin or in combination with insulin.

**Second-line options:**

* **Insulin:** Consider if blood glucose levels remain elevated despite optimal diet and exercise, or if there are signs of diabetic ketoacidosis.
	+ Start with small doses (e.g., total daily dose of 6-10 units) of NPH insulin or premixed insulin (which has 30% regular and 70% NPH insulin), subcutaneously.

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:**
	+ Fasting plasma glucose
	+ 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose during OGTT
	+ HbA1c every 6-8 weeks
	+ Lipid profile and renal function tests as needed
* **Follow-up Schedule:** Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider, ideally every 4-6 weeks for the first few months after diagnosis.
* **Patient Education:**
	+ Emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise)
	+ Provide education on medication management (if applicable)
	+ Encourage regular self-monitoring of blood glucose
* **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage patients to:
	+ Maintain a healthy weight
	+ Engage in regular physical activity
	+ Follow a balanced diet

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:**
	+ Metformin contraindicated in severe renal impairment or acute kidney injury.
	+ Glibenclamide contraindicated in patients with a history of hypoglycemia or those taking other sulfonylureas.
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Pregnancy: Use metformin as first-line treatment; consider insulin if blood glucose levels remain elevated despite optimal diet and exercise.
	+ Renal impairment: Use caution when prescribing metformin, and monitor renal function closely.

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Monitor blood glucose regularly:** Encourage patients to self-monitor their blood glucose levels at least twice daily.
* **Adjust treatment as needed:** Be prepared to adjust treatment plans based on changes in blood glucose levels or presence of complications (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis).
* **Emphasize lifestyle modifications:** Stress the importance of diet and exercise in managing Type 2 diabetes.

**Note:** This guideline is intended for general use, but specific protocols should be verified with local guidelines.
