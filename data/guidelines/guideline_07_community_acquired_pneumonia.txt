**Community-Acquired Pneumonia**

**Category:** Infectious Disease

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an infection of the lung tissue caused by various bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** CAP affects approximately 5-10% of adults in a given year, with a higher incidence in older adults (>65 years).
* **Risk Factors:**
	+ Age >65 years
	+ Chronic medical conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes)
	+ Weakened immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer)
	+ Smoking or alcohol abuse

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:** Fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and sputum production.
* **History Findings:**
	+ Recent travel or exposure to respiratory pathogens
	+ Underlying medical conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes)
	+ Medications that suppress the immune system (e.g., corticosteroids)
* **Physical Examination Findings:** Signs of consolidation or pleural effusion on chest examination.

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:**
	+ Presence of fever, cough, and shortness of breath
	+ Chest X-ray showing signs of consolidation or pleural effusion
* **Laboratory Tests:**
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC) to evaluate for infection and inflammation
	+ C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation
	+ Blood culture and sensitivity to identify causative organism
* **Imaging Studies:** Chest X-ray to evaluate lung fields and pleural space.
* **Other Investigations:**
	+ Sputum gram stain and culture to identify bacterial pathogens
	+ Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli (to exclude TB)

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

* **First-Line Treatment:**
	+ For adults:
		- Chlorpheniramine maleate, oral: 4 mg 12 hourly
	+ For children:
		- 6-12 years: 2 mg 6-12 hourly (max. 12 mg daily)
		- 2-6 years: 1 mg 6-8 hourly (max. 6 mg daily)
		- <2 years: Not recommended
* **Second-Line Options:** Based on culture results and assessment of patient response to initial treatment.
* **Treatment Modifications based on Severity:**
	+ CURB-65 severity score:
		- Confusion, restlessness, or excessive drowsiness (1 point)
		- Blood Urea Nitrogen (>7 mmol/L) (1 point)
		- Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min (1 point)
		- Blood pressure <90 mmHg systolic or <60 mmHg diastolic (1 point)
		- Age ≥65 years (1 point)

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:**
	+ Vital signs
	+ Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry
	+ Chest X-ray to evaluate response to treatment
* **Follow-up Schedule:** Regular follow-ups with healthcare provider to assess response to treatment and manage complications.
* **Patient Education:** Educate patients on importance of completing full course of antibiotics, avoiding smoking and alcohol abuse, and practicing good hygiene.

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:**
	+ Chlorpheniramine maleate contraindicated in children <2 years
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Elderly: Monitor for cognitive impairment and adjust dosages accordingly.
	+ Pregnancy: Avoid chlorpheniramine maleate; use alternative treatments if necessary.
	+ Renal Impairment: Adjust dosages based on creatinine clearance.
* **Drug Interactions:** Chlorpheniramine maleate may interact with other medications (e.g., sedatives, antidepressants).

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Important Clinical Tips:**
	+ Start antibiotics immediately based on knowledge of most probable causative organism and local resistance patterns.
	+ Use CURB-65 severity score to guide treatment decisions.
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
	+ Not considering underlying medical conditions or medications that suppress the immune system.
	+ Failing to monitor for complications (e.g., pleural effusion, pneumothorax).
* **Red Flags:** Sudden worsening of symptoms, increased respiratory rate, or decreased oxygen saturation.
