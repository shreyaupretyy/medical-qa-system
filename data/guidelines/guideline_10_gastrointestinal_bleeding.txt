**Gastrointestinal Bleeding**
**Category:** Gastroenterology

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) refers to the loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, which can range from mild to life-threatening. The source material does not provide specific prevalence or incidence rates for GIB.

Risk factors for GIB include:

* Age > 60 years
* History of peptic ulcer disease (PUD)
* Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
* Helicobacter pylori infection
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

### 2. Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation of GIB may include:

* Signs:
	+ Tachycardia
	+ Hypotension
	+ Pallor
	+ Melena (black, tarry stools)
	+ Hematochezia (fresh blood in stool)
* Symptoms:
	+ Abdominal pain or discomfort
	+ Nausea and vomiting
	+ Bloating and gas
	+ Weight loss

History findings may include:

* Recent use of NSAIDs or anticoagulants
* History of PUD, GERD, or other gastrointestinal conditions
* Family history of bleeding disorders

Physical examination findings may include:

* Abdominal tenderness or guarding
* Signs of dehydration (dry mouth, decreased urine output)

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

Diagnostic criteria for GIB include:

* Presence of melena or hematochezia
* Decreased hemoglobin or hematocrit levels
* Endoscopy or imaging studies to identify the source of bleeding

Laboratory tests may include:

* Complete blood count (CBC)
* Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time)
* Liver function tests (LFTs)

Imaging studies may include:

* Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
* Barium swallow or upper GI series
* Computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound

Other investigations may include:

* Stool for occult blood
* Endoscopic examination of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract
* Biopsy to rule out malignancy or other conditions

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

**First-line treatment:**

1. **Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD):**
	* Magnesium trisilicate, oral, 15 ml 8 hourly (in-between meals and at bedtime)
	* Aluminium hydroxide, oral, 500 mg 6 hourly (in-between meals and at bedtime)
2. **NSAID-associated duodenal or gastric ulcer:**
	* Esomeprazole, oral, 20-40 mg daily for 4-8 weeks
3. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD):**
	* Omeprazole, oral, 20 mg 12 hourly for 14 days

**Second-line options:**

1. **Failed medical treatment or complications:**
	* Surgical treatment may be considered in chronic cases with severe periodic attacks, failed medical treatment, and complications such as perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, and hemorrhage.

**Treatment modifications based on severity:**

1. **Mild bleeding:** Medical treatment as above
2. **Moderate bleeding:** Endoscopic examination to identify the source of bleeding, followed by medical treatment
3. **Severe bleeding:** Emergency endoscopy or surgical intervention may be required

### 5. Management and Follow-up

**Monitoring parameters:**

1. Hemoglobin levels
2. Complete blood count (CBC)
3. Coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time)

**Follow-up schedule:**

1. Initial follow-up: 7-10 days after treatment initiation
2. Subsequent follow-ups: every 4-6 weeks for 3-6 months

**Patient education:**

1. Importance of adherence to medication regimen
2. Lifestyle modifications (e.g., avoiding NSAIDs, smoking cessation)
3. Recognition of warning signs requiring escalation (e.g., worsening symptoms, melena or hematochezia)

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

**Drug contraindications:**

1. Magnesium trisilicate: renal impairment
2. Aluminium hydroxide: severe constipation, electrolyte imbalance
3. Esomeprazole: pregnancy (category C), lactation

**Special populations:**

1. Elderly: consider age-related changes in physiology and potential interactions with medications
2. Pregnancy: avoid NSAIDs and certain antacids; use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) cautiously
3. Renal impairment: adjust doses of magnesium trisilicate and aluminium hydroxide accordingly

**Drug interactions:**

1. Avoid taking antacids within 2 hours of PPIs (e.g., omeprazole, esomeprazole)

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* Recognize the importance of a thorough history and physical examination in diagnosing GIB
* Use endoscopy or imaging studies to identify the source of bleeding when possible
* Tailor treatment to the underlying cause of GIB
* Monitor patients closely for signs of complications or worsening symptoms
