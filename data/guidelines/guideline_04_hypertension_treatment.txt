### 1. Definition and Epidemiology
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure levels. According to the source material, hypertension in children is defined as an average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 95th percentile for gender, age, and height on 3 or more separate occasions taken in the right arm.

Prevalence and incidence rates are not mentioned in the provided source material. However, it is essential to note that hypertension is a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting approximately one billion adults (1). Risk factors include:

* Family history of hypertension
* Obesity
* Physical inactivity
* Smoking
* Excessive sodium intake
* Age (increasing risk with age)
* Ethnicity (higher prevalence in African Americans)

### 2. Clinical Presentation
The clinical presentation of hypertension can vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Common signs and symptoms include:

* Chest pain
* Headaches
* Dyspnea on exertion
* Excessive sweating
* Leg swelling
* Palpitations
* Haematuria (blood in urine)
* Unconsciousness (hypertensive encephalopathy)

History findings may reveal:

* Family history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease
* Presence of other comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus or kidney disease

Physical examination findings may include:

* Elevated blood pressure readings
* Signs of target organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or retinopathy

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup
The diagnostic criteria for hypertension are based on the source material's definition in children: an average systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure that is ≥ 95th percentile for gender, age, and height.

Laboratory tests may include:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC)
* Electrolyte panel
* Renal function tests (eGFR)
* Lipid profile

Imaging studies may be ordered to evaluate target organ damage or underlying causes of secondary hypertension. These may include:

* Echocardiogram
* Chest X-ray
* Abdominal ultrasound

Other investigations, such as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, may be used to confirm the diagnosis and assess treatment efficacy.

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

**First-line treatment:**

* For uncomplicated hypertension in adults:
	+ Thiazide diuretics (e.g., Bendroflumethiazide or Hydrochlorothiazide)
	+ Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) (e.g., Amlodipine)
	+ Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I) (e.g., Lisinopril)
	+ Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) (e.g., Losartan)
	+ Beta-blockers (e.g., Metoprolol)
* For uncomplicated hypertension in children:
	+ Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight management)

**Second-line options:**

* Add-on medications from the first-line choices
* Compelling indications for specific antihypertensives (see source material)

**Treatment modifications based on severity:**

* Dual therapy should be started earlier when blood pressure exceeds 180/110 mmHg.
* Additional anti-hypertensive drugs should be used if target blood pressure levels are not achieved.

### 5. Management and Follow-up
Monitoring parameters include:

* Blood pressure readings at each visit
* Renal function tests (eGFR)
* Lipid profile

Follow-up schedule:

* Initial follow-up: 1-2 weeks after starting treatment
* Subsequent follow-ups: every 4-6 weeks until blood pressure is controlled

Patient education:

* Importance of lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight management)
* Adherence to medication regimen
* Monitoring and reporting symptoms or concerns

Lifestyle modifications:

* Dietary changes (reduced sodium intake, increased potassium intake)
* Regular physical activity
* Weight management
* Smoking cessation

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications for specific medications include:

* Thiazide diuretics: gout
* Beta-blockers: asthma, 2nd and 3rd degree AV block
* CCBs: heart failure
* ACE-I or ARBs: bilateral renal artery stenosis, hyperkalemia

Special populations:

* Elderly: cautious use of antihypertensive medications due to increased risk of adverse effects
* Pregnancy: careful selection of antihypertensive medications (see source material)
* Renal impairment: cautious use of ACE-I or ARBs due to potential for renal dysfunction

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls
Important clinical tips:

* Regular monitoring of blood pressure and renal function
* Adherence to medication regimen
* Lifestyle modifications are essential in the management of hypertension

Common pitfalls to avoid:

* Inadequate treatment of underlying causes of secondary hypertension
* Failure to monitor and adjust treatment as needed

Red flags requiring escalation:

* Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal treatment
* Presence of target organ damage or end-organ dysfunction
* Development of adverse effects or contraindications to specific medications
