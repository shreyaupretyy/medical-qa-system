**Liver Cirrhosis Complications**

**Category:** Gastroenterology

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

Liver cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease characterized by fibrosis and nodule formation, leading to loss of liver function. The prevalence of liver cirrhosis varies globally, but it is estimated that approximately 2% of the population in developed countries has cirrhosis.

Risk factors for developing liver cirrhosis include:

* Chronic hepatitis B or C infection
* Alcoholic liver disease
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
* Hemochromatosis
* Wilson's disease

### 2. Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of liver cirrhosis can vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the disease. Common signs and symptoms include:

* Jaundice
* Fatigue
* Weight loss
* Abdominal swelling (ascites)
* Spider nevi
* Palmar erythema
* Clubbing

History findings may include:

* History of alcohol use or other potential liver toxins
* Family history of liver disease
* Previous liver-related complications (e.g., variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy)

Physical examination findings may include:

* Hepatomegaly
* Splenomegaly
* Ascites
* Peripheral edema

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis is primarily based on clinical evaluation and laboratory tests.

Diagnostic criteria:

* Liver biopsy (gold standard)
* Imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan)

Laboratory tests:

* Complete blood count (CBC)
* Liver function tests (LFTs)
* Coagulation studies
* Viral hepatitis serologies (HBV, HCV)
* Hepatitis A and E IgM

Imaging studies:

* Ultrasound
* CT scan
* MRI

Other investigations:

* Endoscopy for varices or other complications
* Liver function tests (LFTs) to assess liver synthetic function

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

The treatment of liver cirrhosis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the disease.

**First-line treatment:**

* For chronic hepatitis C:
	+ Pegylated interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b, subcutaneously
	+ Ribavirin, orally
* For chronic hepatitis B:
	+ Entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, orally

**Second-line options:**

* For chronic hepatitis C:
	+ Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, orally (for genotype 1)
	+ Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, orally (for genotype 2-6)
* For chronic hepatitis B:
	+ Adefovir or lamivudine, orally

**Treatment modifications based on severity:**

* Mild cirrhosis: Monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies regularly
* Moderate cirrhosis: Consider antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C or B
* Severe cirrhosis: Consider liver transplantation evaluation

### 5. Management and Follow-up

Monitoring parameters:

* Liver function tests (LFTs)
* Coagulation studies
* Viral hepatitis serologies (HBV, HCV)

Follow-up schedule:

* Every 3-6 months for mild cirrhosis
* Every 1-2 months for moderate cirrhosis
* Every 1 month for severe cirrhosis

Patient education:

* Lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight loss, exercise)
* Avoidance of hepatotoxic substances (e.g., alcohol, certain medications)

Lifestyle modifications:

* Weight loss and exercise to reduce liver fat content
* Avoidance of hepatotoxic substances

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

**Drug contraindications:**

* Ribavirin in pregnancy or breastfeeding
* Interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b in patients with severe depression or suicidal ideation

**Special populations:**

* Elderly patients: Consider reduced doses of antiviral medications
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Avoid ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a or alfa-2b
* Renal impairment: Monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies regularly

**Drug interactions:**

* Avoid concurrent use of warfarin with antiviral medications (e.g., entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

Important clinical tips:

* Consider liver transplantation evaluation for severe cirrhosis
* Monitor liver function tests and coagulation studies regularly
* Avoid hepatotoxic substances (e.g., alcohol, certain medications)

Common pitfalls to avoid:

* Delayed diagnosis or treatment of underlying cause
* Inadequate monitoring of liver function tests and coagulation studies

Red flags:

* Rapid progression of cirrhosis
* Development of variceal bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy
