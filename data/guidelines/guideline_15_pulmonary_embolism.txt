**Pulmonary Embolism**

**Category:** Respiratory

### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a condition where one or more arteries in the lungs become blocked by a blood clot, leading to reduced blood flow to the lung tissue.

* Prevalence: Estimated to affect approximately 1-2 per 1000 adults per year.
* Risk factors:
	+ Age > 40 years
	+ Family history of PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
	+ Recent surgery or trauma
	+ Immobility or prolonged bed rest
	+ Cancer or chemotherapy
	+ Obesity
	+ Smoking

### 2. Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation may vary depending on the size and location of the embolism.

* Signs and symptoms:
	+ Sudden onset of chest pain (pleuritic)
	+ Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
	+ Coughing up blood (hemoptysis)
	+ Syncope or near-syncope
	+ Tachycardia or bradycardia
* History findings:
	+ Recent surgery, trauma, or immobilization
	+ Family history of PE or DVT
	+ Cancer or chemotherapy treatment
* Physical examination findings:
	+ Tachypnea (rapid breathing rate)
	+ Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
	+ Hypotension (low blood pressure)

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

Diagnostic criteria for PE include:

* Clinical presentation consistent with PE
* Imaging studies showing a filling defect in the pulmonary arteries

Laboratory tests:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC) to rule out infection or anemia
* D-dimer test to assess for clotting disorders
* Electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate cardiac rhythm and function

Imaging studies:

* Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing PE.
* Ventilation-Perfusion Scan (VPS) may be used in patients with contraindications to CTPA.

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

First-line treatment for PE includes:

* **Warfarin**: Loading dose of 10 mg orally, followed by a daily dose of 5 mg until an INR of 2-3 is achieved.
	+ Continue warfarin at a maintenance dose of 2.5-5 mg daily (or 7.5 mg in some patients) for 3-6 months if the risk factor is temporary or unknown.
* **Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)**: May be used as an alternative to warfarin, especially in patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants.

Second-line options:

* Thrombolytic therapy may be considered for patients with severe PE and hemodynamic instability.

### 5. Management and Follow-up

Monitoring parameters:

* INR levels
* CBC and D-dimer tests as needed
* ECG monitoring for cardiac rhythm and function

Follow-up schedule:

* Regular follow-up appointments to monitor INR levels and adjust warfarin dose as needed.
* Patients should be educated on the importance of adhering to their medication regimen and attending follow-up appointments.

Lifestyle modifications:

* Encourage patients to engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy weight, and avoid smoking.

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

Contraindications to warfarin include:

* Pregnancy or breastfeeding
* Renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min)
* Severe liver disease
* Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding

Special populations:

* Elderly patients may require dose adjustments due to decreased renal function.
* Pregnant women should not receive warfarin; LMWH is recommended instead.

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

Important clinical tips:

* Patients with suspected PE should be referred to a cardiologist or physician specialist for expert management after stabilization.
* Regular follow-up appointments are crucial to monitor INR levels and adjust warfarin dose as needed.

Common pitfalls to avoid:

* Failing to recognize the importance of adhering to medication regimen and attending follow-up appointments.
* Not monitoring INR levels regularly, leading to inadequate anticoagulation or excessive bleeding risk.

Red flags:

* Sudden onset of chest pain or shortness of breath
* Hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia)
* High-risk patients (e.g., those with cancer or recent surgery)

Please note that specific protocols should be verified with local guidelines.
