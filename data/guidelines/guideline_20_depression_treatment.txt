### 1. Definition and Epidemiology

* **Definition:** Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities.
* **Prevalence/Incidence:** Depression is twice as common in women as in men, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide (Source: World Health Organization).
* **Risk Factors:**
	+ Genetic predisposition
	+ Familial history
	+ Environmental factors (e.g., trauma, stress)
	+ Psychosocial factors (e.g., social isolation, low self-esteem)
	+ Endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome)

### 2. Clinical Presentation

* **Signs and Symptoms:**
	+ Depressed mood
	+ Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
	+ Significant weight loss or gain
	+ Insomnia or excessive sleepiness
	+ Psychomotor agitation or retardation
	+ Fatigue or loss of energy
	+ Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
	+ Impaired thinking and concentration
* **History Findings:**
	+ Patient's medical history, including previous episodes of depression
	+ Family history of psychiatric disorders
	+ Social and occupational functioning
* **Physical Examination Findings:**
	+ Weight changes
	+ Sleep patterns
	+ Appetite changes

### 3. Diagnostic Criteria and Workup

* **Diagnostic Criteria:** Major depressive disorder is diagnosed when at least five (5) symptoms listed above are present for at least two weeks.
* **Laboratory Tests:**
	+ Complete Blood Count (FBC)
	+ Basic Metabolic Panel (BUE and Creatinine)
	+ Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)
	+ Thyroid function tests
	+ Cortisol levels if indicated
* **Imaging Studies:** None specifically mentioned in the source material.
* **Other Investigations:**
	+ Administer a standardized scale of depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9)

### 4. Treatment Algorithm

* **First-Line Treatment:**
	+ Fluoxetine (Prozac):
		- Adults: 20 mg once daily for 2-4 weeks, then increase to a maximum of 80 mg
		- Children and adolescents (8-18 years): 10 mg once daily for 1-2 weeks, then increase to a maximum of 20 mg once daily
* **Second-Line Options:**
	+ Melatonin:
		- Adults: 3-5 mg daily, 1-2 hours before bedtime (maximum 10 mg)
		- Children and adolescents (1 month-18 years): 2-3 mg at bedtime, increase if necessary after 1-2 weeks to 4-6 mg daily (maximum 10 mg)
* **Treatment Modifications Based on Severity:**
	+ Refer patients with suicidal tendencies or severe depression for immediate hospitalization
	+ Consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression

### 5. Management and Follow-up

* **Monitoring Parameters:**
	+ Symptom severity
	+ Medication side effects
	+ Suicidal ideation
* **Follow-up Schedule:**
	+ Regular follow-ups with the patient's primary care physician or mental health professional
	+ Adjustments to treatment plan as needed
* **Patient Education:**
	+ Importance of adherence to medication regimen
	+ Lifestyle modifications (e.g., regular exercise, healthy diet)
	+ Coping mechanisms for managing symptoms

### 6. Contraindications and Precautions

* **Drug Contraindications:**
	+ Fluoxetine contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or conditions that may lower the seizure threshold
	+ Melatonin contraindicated in patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulant medications
* **Special Populations:**
	+ Elderly patients: start with lower doses and monitor for side effects
	+ Pregnant women: use fluoxetine with caution, as it may affect fetal development
	+ Renal impairment: adjust medication dosages accordingly
* **Drug Interactions:**
	+ Fluoxetine interacts with many medications, including warfarin, phenytoin, and certain antidepressants
	+ Melatonin interacts with sedatives, hypnotics, and other sleep aids

### 7. Key Clinical Pearls

* **Important Clinical Tips:**
	+ Recognize depression as a treatable condition
	+ Use standardized scales to assess symptom severity
	+ Monitor for suicidal ideation and adjust treatment plan accordingly
* **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
	+ Underestimating the severity of symptoms or dismissing patient concerns
	+ Failing to monitor medication side effects or adjust dosages as needed
	+ Not providing adequate support and resources for patients with depression

**Red Flags:**

* Suicidal ideation or attempts
* Severe depressive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions)
* Failure to respond to treatment after 6 weeks of therapy
